The Request:

Your task is to build a RESTful API that retrieves information from NHTSA and presents it to the user.
Build a search bar that will interact with your API to retrieve the vehicle information given a VIN number.
Requirements:

Your API must support the following functions:

Get a list of all manufacturers (e.g. Toyota, Honda, etc.)
Get a list of all makes given a manufacturer (e.g. for Toyota: Corolla, Prius, etc.)
Get the year, make, and model of a vehicle given its VIN (e.g. for 3N1AB6AP7BL729215: 2011 Nissan Sentra)
Validate the incoming VIN number.
Use a well-established framework such as Express to implement your solution.
Have well-documented code.
Write unit tests to ensure the integrity of the code.
Resources:

Refer to https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/ for their API documentation.
You may use https://randomvin.com/ to generate valid VINs for testing.
